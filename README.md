## snippets

[remove files icons](remove%20file%20icons.css)

- a css snippet that removes the `Iconize` plugin's icons next to files in `Files` and `Bookmarks`

[small pinned tabs](small%20pinned%20tabs.css)

- a css snippet that removes tab icons from all tabs besides pinned tabs

  - to achieve this with `Iconize`, enable `Toggle Icon in Tabs` and `Use icon in frontmatter`, and download an icon pack

    - then, add an `icon` property with a string of `{icon pack shorthand}{capitalized name of icon}`

- shrinks pinned tabs so only the icon can be seen
